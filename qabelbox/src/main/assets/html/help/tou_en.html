<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T1">[b] Qabel service features the sharing of content with other users. The user is advised to carefully consider with whom he/she shares such content. The user must carefully verify content in particular regarding any third party rights, before sharing it with others and must share content only with persons who trustworthy are personally known to him/her.</span></a>
</p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T1">[c] To access Qabel services a password is required. The provider strongly recommends to abide by the principles of a safe password assignment. In addition, the user must keep the key, which has been generated by the Qabel service, private and secure from access by any unauthorized third party. In case the user has evidence that his / her account has been compromised or misused by a third party, he/she must inform the provider immediately.</span></a>

<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T1">[d] The user is not allowed to relinquish or otherwise assign his/her rights and duties under this agreement.</span></a>

<p class="P4"><a id="_GoBack">&nbsp;</a></p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T2">[6] Fair Use </span></a></p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T1">[a] The provider strives to make the Qabel services available in constant quality and speed. Excessive use of a few users, however, may overburden the capacity of Qabel services as a whole and therefore negatively impact the software performance for the majority of users.</span></a>
</p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T1">For that reason the provider reserves the right to suspend, restrict or terminate user accounts in case of excessive use of Qabel services (for instance in case of overly high traffic). Please refer to our Fair Use Policy for detailed information.</span></a>
</p>
<p class="P4"><a id="_GoBack">&nbsp;</a></p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T2">[7] Intellectual Property</span></a></p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T1">[a] The Qabel service and the software that is used for it are protected by intellectual property rights, including copyright and industrial property rights. As long as the user complies with these Terms of Service, provider grants a restricted, non-transferrable, revocable license, to use the software to access and use the Qabel services. </span></a>
</p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T1">[b] As long as the software or their single components are offered under an open source licence, we will make that licence available. Provisions of such licence may modify provisions of these terms and conditions.</span></a>
</p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T1">[c] The user grants the provider the right to the data, which is stored in its data storage, only to such extent necessary to provide the Qabel service according to this agreement. </span></a>
</p>
<p class="P4"><a id="_GoBack">&nbsp;</a></p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T2">[8] Cooperation with authorities - Procedures for copyright violations </span></a>
</p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T1">[a] For prevention and investigation of criminal offenses the provider cooperates with legal authorities as required by applicable laws. It must be emphasised that the provider has no access to encryption keys to decrypt content that has been stored by the user. The provider may block users when it is required by law or judicial or administrative order.</span></a>
</p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T1">[b] Upon notification of an alleged copyright violation, provider responds to this if the notification complies with the law and DMCA </span><span
        class="T4">guideline [LINK].</span><span class="T1"> The provider reserves the right to deactivate the account of users that presumably violate copyright or to delete the account of users that repeatedly violate the copyright of third parties.</span></a>
</p>
<p class="P4"><a id="_GoBack">&nbsp;</a></p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T2">[9] Liability</span></a></p>

</p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T1">[b] The user must indemnify provider from any third party claims that are based on the data the user has stored on the providers system. This includes compensation for all expenses the provider incurs in connection with the users alleged rights violations. It also includes reasonable expenses for legal actions.</span></a>
</p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T1">[c] The provider may immediately suspend the test storage accounts when there is reasonable evidence that stored data is unlawful and/or violates the rights of third parties. A reasonable evidence may be assumed if a court, authorities and/or third parties notify the provider of such violations. The provider will notify the user of suspension and its reasons immediately.</span></a>
</p>
<p class="P4"><a id="_GoBack">&nbsp;</a></p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T2">[10] Termination</span></a></p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T1">[a] The user may terminate the agreement with the provider at any time by deleting the account by e-mail to delete@qabel.de. The provider reserves ­– because this is a beta test – the right to terminate the contract at any time and without announcement.</span></a>
</p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T1">[b] Furthermore, the provider reserves the right to terminate the contract based on serious grounds. A serious ground is – inter alia – constituted by a misuse of the Qabel service according to Sec. 5 of the Terms of Service.</span></a>
</p>
<p class="P4"><a id="_GoBack">&nbsp;</a></p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T2">[11] Changes of Terms of Services</span></a></p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T1">The provider reserves the right to change these Terms of Service. The user will be informed about changes on the front page of the Qabel client or by e-mail. Changes in favour of the user take effect immediately or, provided that a date of entry into force is determined, on that date. Changes not in favour of the user restricting his/her rights not only insignificantly, take effect at least two weeks after the user has been informed and not deleted his/her account.</span></a>
</p>
<p class="P4"><a id="_GoBack">&nbsp;</a></p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T2">[12] Miscellaneous</span></a></p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T1">[a] Changes, additions and terminations of contractual agreements must be in writing, as well as the revocation of the requirement for the written form, unless these terms and conditions require the written form themselves.</span></a>
</p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T1">[b] If any provision of this agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the validity of the remaining provisions will not be affected. The invalid provision shall </span><span
        class="T1">be replaced by a valid provision that best reflects the commercial purpose of the invalid provision. The same shall apply to omissions.</span></a>
</p>
<p class="P3"><a id="_GoBack"><span class="T1">[c] This agreement shall be exclusively governed by the laws and statutes of the Federal Republic of Germany. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall be excluded. If the customer is a businessperson, the competent court at the providers headquarter shall have exclusive jurisdiction for all dispute arising out or from this agreement. The provider may also file proceedings to the competent court at the customer’s place of residence.</span></a>
