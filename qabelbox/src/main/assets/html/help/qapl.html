    ** The software "Qabel" is licensed under the QaPL, a specially developed proprietary license.
    <br/> The QaPL can neither be classified according to the standards of
    <br/> the Free Software Foundation (FSF), nor to the standards of the Open Source Initiative (OSI)
    <br/> as "Free Software License" or "Open Source License" respectively.
    <br/>
    <br/> We have decided to do it that way in order to keep the project going, while at the same time
    <br/> ensuring the greatest possible freedom.
    <br/>
    <br/> The QaPL does not satisfy the standards of those "Open Source" or "Free Software" licenses,
    <br/> due to our non-commercialization and non-military clauses.**

    <br/> Qabel Public License Version 0.2 (QaPL v0.2) (c) Qabel GmbH, Hannover
    <br/>
    <br/> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license agreement. You may
    <br/> also use content from it for your own license agreement. Unless not expressly
    <br/> stated, you may not use the name Qabel Public License ("QaPL") in connection
    <br/> with any license agreement that is not a verbatim copy of This License.
    <br/>
    <br/> PREAMBLE Today Software is the undisputed centerpiece of the information
    <br/> society and access to software and information society services became a public
    <br/> commodity. Yet traditional software is made available in object code only,
    <br/> where the software user is not entitled to study or even modify the source
    <br/> code. We believe that this is a salient shortcoming in particular when it comes
    <br/> to software which is designed to help the user protect his privacy in a virtual
    <br/> world. A proprietary software developer who refuses to unveil the source code
    <br/> of its security software, requires users to place a great deal of faith into
    <br/> the computer program and its ability to protect personal data. Not only because
    <br/> trust in conventional software security was all too often disappointed, we have
    <br/> decided to replace "trust" with "transparency" and everybody is welcome to
    <br/> study, modify and improve the source code of this software. Furthermore, and
    <br/> although we believe in the idea of free software, we have decided to make two
    <br/> important exceptions, to wit, QaPL-licensed software should neither be used
    <br/> commercially without our consent, nor for military, intelligence or related
    <br/> purposes. By that we hope to make it a powerful, self sustaining and constantly
    <br/> evolving tool that helps to reinforce data security and the protection of
    <br/> personal data. However, it shall be up to the user to decide whether he finds
    <br/> this software fit for the purpose.

    <br/>
    <br/> [4] Contributor's License Grant
    <br/> [a] A Contributor, who distributes or makes publicly available a Modification,
    <br/> hereby grants the Original Copyright Holder a perpetual, irrevocable,
    <br/> worldwide, free of charge, royalty-free, non-exclusive, unrestricted license
    <br/> that may be subject to third party property claims, to use, reproduce, modify,
    <br/> display, perform, sublicense, distribute, Make Publicly Available, commercially
    <br/> exploit and exercise all ownership rights in the Contributors contribution.
    <br/> Contributor hereby agrees that he will not assert any moral rights in his
    <br/> contribution against the Original Copyright Holder.
    <br/> [b] A contributor, who distributes or makes publicly available a Modification,
    <br/> hereby grants to the Original Copyright Holder a perpetual, worldwide,
    <br/> non-exclusive, free-of-charge, royalty-free patent license to make, have made,
    <br/> use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Library or other
    <br/> software licensed under the QaPL. Where such license applies it shall only
    <br/> apply to those patent claims licensable by the Contributor that are necessarily
    <br/> infringed by their contributions alone or by combination of their contributions
    <br/> with the Library or other software licensed under the QaPL with which such
    <br/> contribution was combined.
    <br/> [c] Contributor represents and warrants that his contribution is his own
    <br/> original creation and to the best of his knowledge he can legally grant the
    <br/> rights in his contribution set out in This License and, where applicable, is
    <br/> authorised by his employer and that the Original Copyright Holder exercising
    <br/> the rights granted under this license does, to the best of the Contributors
    <br/> knowledge, not infringe any third party rights. Contributor further represents
    <br/> that he is not aware of any claims, suits or court actions in relation to his
    <br/> contribution. Contributor agrees that he will immediately notify the Original
    <br/> Copyright Holder if he becomes aware of any third party claims and, if the
    <br/> Contributor after having submitted or otherwise distributed his contribution,
    <br/> becomes aware of a third party claim in relation to his contribution, shall
    <br/> promptly take all reasonable measures to mitigate damages resulting from the
    <br/> infringement of third party claims, including but not limited to informing
    <br/> those who may have received software containing the contribution.
    <br/>
    <br/> [5] Conclusion of Contract
    <br/> [a] This License constitutes the offer to conclude a contract to use the
    <br/> Library or other software licensed under the QaPL in compliance with the
    <br/> conditions of This License. Acceptance may be declared by exercising the right
    <br/> granted under sec. [2] of This License.
    <br/> [b] All Licensees obtain the rights granted by This License directly from the
    <br/> Original Copyright Holder. Without having to accept This License the Library or
    <br/> other software may still be used in accordance with the applicable statutory
    <br/> provisions.
    <br/>
    <br/> [6] Termination The rights granted under This License will terminate
    <br/> automatically if the Licensee fails to comply with its terms.
    <br/>
    <br/> [7] Warranty and Liability
    <br/> [a] The copyright holders are not liable for contradictory third-party rights,
    <br/> unless they were aware of such rights without informing the Licensee.
    <br/> [b] Liability for damages arising out of the use or inability to use the
    <br/> Library or other software licensed under the QaPL, including but not limited to
    <br/> software failure, data loss, data being rendered inaccurate, a failure of the
    <br/> software to operate with any other program and any other defects in the Library
    <br/> or other software licensed under the QaPL, shall be governed by separate
    <br/> agreements, or, if no such agreement exists, by the applicable statutory
    <br/> provisions.
    <br/>
    <br/> [8] License Updates Qabel GmbH or its legal successors may, from
    <br/> time to time, revise and update the QaPL in order to address new developments
    <br/> and concerns. These revisions and updates will reflect the spirit of the
    <br/> current license version and will not impose on any Licensee or copyright holder
    <br/> additional obligations. QaPL license updates shall replace all older license
    <br/> versions in existing agreements. This does not apply to original copyright
    <br/> holders other than Qabel GmbH, who have chosen to submit their program to the
    <br/> QaPL, unless they have designated their program as licensed under "QaPL 0.2
    <br/> or any later version".
    <br/>
    <br/> [9] Miscellaneous
    <br/> [a] This License shall be governed by German Law. The
    <br/> application of the UN Convention on the International Sale of Goods (CISG) and
    <br/> the principles of conflict of laws shall be excluded.
    <br/> [b] If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library or other software licensed
    <br/> under the QaPL into other software whose license terms contradict with the
    <br/> provisions of this license, you may inquire with either the Original Copyright
    <br/> Holder or the copyright holder of the other software on possible exceptions.
    <br/> [c] If, under the applicable law, any provision of This License is or becomes
    <br/> invalid or unenforceable, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    <br/> the remainder of the terms of This License, and without further action by the
    <br/> parties to This License, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
    <br/> necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
    <br/>

    <br/> Appendix:
    <br/> Feel free to use the QaPL for your own software
    <br/> project. In that case you may replace Qabel GmbH as the Original Copyright
    <br/> Holder as stated in Sec. [0][c] with your own name or entity. It is recommended
    <br/> to affix the following copyright notice to your software
    <br/>
    <br/> "Copyright (C) 20[yy] [Name of the original copyright holder]
    <br/>
