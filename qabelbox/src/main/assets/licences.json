For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.\n\nSection 4 \u2013 Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\nfor the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\nif You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\nYou must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\nSection 5 \u2013 Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\nUnless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\nTo the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n\nThe disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\nSection 6 \u2013 Term and Termination.\n\nThis Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n\nWhere Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\nSections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\nSection 7 \u2013 Other Terms and Conditions.\n\nThe Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\nAny arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\nSection 8 \u2013 Interpretation.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\nTo the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\nNo term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\nNothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n"

The\n\nfonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, \n\nredistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved\n\nnames are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,\n\nhowever, cannot be released under any other type of license. The\n\nrequirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply\n\nto any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.\n\n\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\n\"Font Software\" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright\n\nHolder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may\n\ninclude source files, build scripts and documentation.\n\n\n\n\"Reserved Font Name\" refers to any names specified as such after the\n\ncopyright statement(s).\n\n\n\n\"Original Version\" refers to the collection of Font Software components as\n\ndistributed by the Copyright Holder(s).\n\n\n\n\"Modified Version\" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,\n\nor substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the\n\nOriginal Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a\n\nnew environment.\n\n\n\n\"Author\" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical\n\nwriter or other person who contributed to the Font Software.\n\n\n\nPERMISSION & CONDITIONS\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\n\na copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,\n\nredistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font\n\nSoftware, subject to the following conditions:\n\n\n\n1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,\n\nin Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.\n\n\n\n2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,\n\nredistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy\n\ncontains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be\n\nincluded either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or\n\nin the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or\n\nbinary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.\n\n\n\n3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font\n\nName(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding\n\nCopyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as\n\npresented to the users.\n\n\n\n4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font\n\nSoftware shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any\n\nModified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the\n\nCopyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written\n\npermission.\n\n\n\n5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,\n\nmust be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be\n\ndistributed under any other license.
